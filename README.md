# Test Project for Notebook Team Interns

**Task Description:**

Your task is to implement a Tic-Tac-Toe library that is able to drive a
game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but leaves it up to users of the library to create the
UI. 

After you have implemented the library, you must use it to create a simple
command line game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

It should have the following features:

1. When starting the game, it should request the names of Player X and 
   Player 0.

2. It should print the initial state of the board when players have been named.

3. Each player should then switch choosing a position on the board, placing
   their mark. 

4. The game should print the updated board after each player has placed a mark.

5. When the game is over, the game should print the result of the game.

**Bonus Features:**

6. Make the player type configurable, I.e., it should be possible to choose
   whether one or both of the players are a human or a computer. The computer
   can just place marks at random.

7. Make the computer opponent a real AI, making intelligent decisions.

8. Create a Kotlin Notebook that demonstrates how to use the library.


If you have any questions, please contact christian.melchior@jetbrains.com.


**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Does the code work?
2. Is the code readable?
3. Is the code documented?
4. Are there tests and are they passing?
5. How easy is it to extend the code with new player types or display formats?

It is more important to make the code readable, documented and tested
than implementing new features.


**Prepare to discuss the following topics:**

- Why does your implementation work?

- Why did you choose your particular implementation? What alternatives did 
  you consider?

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of your particular implementation?

- Why did you choose the approach to testing you did? What are the advantages 
  and disadvantages of your particular approach?

It is perfectly fine to use Google, Stack Overflow, OpenAI, Cursor or any other
resource to solve the problem, but you should be prepared to explain your
approach to the interviewer.
